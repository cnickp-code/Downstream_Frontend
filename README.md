# DownStream

https://downstream-frontend.vercel.app/

Have you ever found yourself browsing online in your pajamas at 2PM during this long and arduous quarantine period (I might or might not be speaking from experience) and you happen to spot an awesome music festival stream that is happening three days in the future? And have you ever found yourself four days later randomly remembering that same music festival stream, except now it already passed? This problem is a common occurrence for many a music lover in this unique day and age, where live music's outlet now comes packaged in virtual form. 

Introducing DownStream, the app that will help you to never miss a music stream ever again! DownStream provides a service that allows users to choose from a list of filterable online music events, complete with the name, description, dates, genre, and major artists that will be playing! Users who have an account will be allowed to add events that they want to add to their schedule. From there, users can manage their chosen events. Never again will you miss a music stream with DownStream!

## Motivation

This is a passion project. I love live music. One of my favorite pastimes is experiencing music in person, up close and personal. However, in this very unique situation of nationwide quarantine, all music events have been effectively tabled for the foreseeable future. Enter a new, exciting angle to the music industry that has never before been seen in this volume: online music festivals and streaming. It is quite frustrating to plan on watching certain artists, only to miss their stream completely either due to miscommunication or just simply forgetting. I hope to alleviate that frustration through this app.

My goal with this project is to contribute to the culture and the industry that I love and that has given me so much, from friends, to experiences that I will never forget.
